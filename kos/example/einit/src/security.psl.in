/* This solution security policy allows any interaction between any processes,
 * and between these processes and the KasperskyOS kernel.
 * The "granted" decision will always be received
 * when these processes query the Kaspersky Security Module.
 * This policy can be used only as a stub during the early stages
 * of development of a KasperskyOS-based solution
 * so that the Kaspersky Security Module does not interfere with interactions.
 * It would be unacceptable to apply such a policy
 * in a real-world KasperskyOS-based solution. */
